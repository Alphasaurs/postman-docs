### Where can I find logs for the Postman app?

**Note:** No request-level information is visible to us in the logs or via our internal systems. The only collection-related information that's logged is collection IDs and user IDs.

In the logs noted below, the file(s) _renderer-shared_ is where some details of synced data is referenced; you're welcome to audit it and redact anything you might not want to share.
