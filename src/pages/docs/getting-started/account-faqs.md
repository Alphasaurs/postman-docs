### My session expired - can't reset my password and can't access to old email

If you're logged out due to a session revocation and cannot log back into your account because

- you forgot your password AND
- you can't reset your password as the email associated with your Postman account doesn't longer exist (e.g. the email is a former company-email)

Please submit a ticket to our Support from [this page](https://www.getpostman.com/support) and provide the name of a few workspaces, collections, environment variables and monitors you own on that account so we can verify the account's ownership.

Once we proceed to the account verification, we _should_ be able to send the reset email for that account to another email address.

### Unable to log into application using Google Authentication?

If you are unable to login to the Postman application using Google authentication and if you are receiving the message - "The browser you are trying to login doesn't secure your account" as per the screenshot below:

Unfortunately, you are running into a known issue that is currently being tracked on our GitHub page [here](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/7700). Subscribe to the thread for further updates and feel free to add your comment there as well.  

Currently, we do have a workaround for the same - our team has released a feature that lets you log in to the Postman application via your browser. Click on the link "**Try on a web browser**" as shown in the below screenshot.

### I tried using my credit card to pay for Pro, but the card was declined. What do I do

Unfortunately, we have little visibility over the reason for payments being declined. You can try using the same card after a while, or try another card.

If an automatic payment attempt (to renew your monthly/annual plan) fails, we'll send an invoice to the registered billing email ID. Unpaid invoices will also be visible on the [billing page](https://app.getpostman.com/pay/billing).

Payment instructions can be found in the invoice itself.

Contact us at sales@postman.com for more information.

### I'm seeing a 'deactivated due to non-payment' message. What now?"

This message is shown when any payment due for your Postman Team, Business, or Enterprise plan is overdue. This could be the monthly/annual renewal of the plan, or charges incurred for using Monitoring over the free limit of 10,000 per month.

Once an automatic payment attempt fails, an invoice will be sent to the registered billing email address, and users will see a warning in the app - "Your team has one or more failed payments". Your team will have 30 days to pay the invoices (this can be done at https://go.postman.co/billing/overview) before your plan is deactivated.

As soon as these invoices are paid, your plan will be reactivated automatically. For check payments/bank transfers, the plan is reactivated once we receive the payment.

### I logged in via Google. How do I set a password for my account?

You'll need to head to the [forgot password page](https://app.getpostman.com/forgot-password) and enter your email. You should receive a reset password link on your email, which you can use to set a new password.

### Invite link to team does not work?

Have you tried accepting the "Invite link" from the postman to join the team, but it did not allow you to log in hence you tried clicking on "Trouble signing in" but that did not send you the reset email?

Probably it is because you do not have a Postman account. Please click on "Create account", provide the email id, [unique username](https://support.getpostman.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019302273-Username-already-exists), and password and once the account is created you can click on the "Invite link" which should help you join the team.

![Create Account](https://support.getpostman.com/hc/article_attachments/360053800854/CreateAccount.png)

If you still have issues logging in or joining the team, please reach out to us at [help@postman.com](help@postman.com).

### My credit card was declined - what do I do?

Unfortunately, we have little visibility over the reason for payments being declined. You can try using the same card after a little while, or try another card. You can also contact your credit card provider for more information.

If you are purchasing the Enterprise plan, you can pay via ACH, Wire Transfer or Check.

Contact us at sales@postman.com for more information.

### My Google account has two-factor authentication enabled, and I'm not able to 'Signin with Google' from the Postman app

At this point, Postman offers limited support for 2FA on Google accounts. If you're unable to complete the 2FA login process in the Postman app, your best bet would be to head to the link [Trouble signing in](https://identity.getpostman.com/trouble-signing-in) and request a new password. If you don't see any password reset emails from us even in Spam/ Junk folders, whitelist noreply@notifications.getpostman.com in your email client, or domain policy if necessary.

Once your password is reset, you can use your email + password combination to login through the app.

### Where can I see my synced data?

When using Postman it is best practice to store your requests in collections. Once stored you'll then be able to view all of your synced collections by logging in to your Postman account and navigating to [your dashboard](go.postman.co/me/collections).

As soon as these invoices are paid, your plan will be reactivated automatically. For check payments/bank transfers, the plan is reactivated once we receive the payment.

### I paid for Postman Pro, but haven't received an activation email yet. What do I do?

If you were upgrading an existing trial team, there's no activation needed - you can head to [https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams) to verify that you're on the paid plan.

For new teams, if you had selected the "admin role" during the payment process and were signed in, you'll need to sign in or sign up with the email you provided. Your account will automatically be linked to your purchase. If you were not signed in while making the purchase, check your email for an activation link.

If you selected the "billing role" during payment, an activation email would have been sent to the admin user you specified. If the user reports that they haven't received the email, you could direct the user to check their spam folder.

### Unable to reset password

## Resolution steps

### Forgot password

If you've forgotten your password, please navigate to [this page](https://identity.getpostman.com/trouble-signing-in) and click *Trouble signing in?* in order to receive a password reset link via email. If aren't receiving password reset emails from us, please try the following:

1. Check your email's Spam or Junk folder.
2. Whitelist [noreply@notifications.getpostman.com](noreply@notifications.getpostman.com) in your email client, or domain policy if necessary. You can then request a password reset again, and the email should come through.
3. If you are still unable to receive password reset emails after attempting the above steps, please contact help@postman.com.

### Incorrect email at the time of Registration**

If you accidentally used an invalid email address during signup, and have forgotten your password, please contact [help@postman.com](help@postman.com) for assistance. Please be ready to provide the following information:

1. Account creation date
2. Account last access date
3. At least 5 workspace names
4. At least 5 private collection names
5. At least 5 private environment names
6. At least 5 private monitor names
7. At least 2 previous invoice or receipt numbers
8. Last 4 digits of the card used for purchase(s) on your team

### Username already exists

When you create an account with Postman, it's mandatory to provide the email id, username and password. Postman needs each user to have a unique username.

If you face an error stating _**'An account with this username already exists'**_, try providing the same email as username during signup or try using different permutations of a unique name as username. You won't be able to get a certain username if the username you requested exists in our database.

### Why has my account been deactivated?

For users with a Team, Business, or Enterprise subscription, Postman will be deactivated if you have not paid by the end of our grace period. Please contact help@postman.com for more information.

### Why was my card charged multiple times today?

Your payment history is available at http://go.postman.co/billing/history. If you notice multiple charges to your card on the same day, it's probably our system retrying older payments that failed.

For Postman Team, Business, and Enterprise users, requests made over your Monitoring limit will be charged at $0.75/1000 requests. These charges will not necessarily be made at the same time as your Pro renewal charges. More info on this can be found [here](https://www.postman.com/docs/postman/monitors/pricing_monitors).

No invoice item will be charged to your card more than once.
