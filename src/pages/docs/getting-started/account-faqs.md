### I logged in via Google. How do I set a password for my account?

You'll need to head to the [forgot password page](https://app.getpostman.com/forgot-password) and enter your email. You should receive a reset password link on your email, which you can use to set a new password.


### Invite link to team does not work?

Have you tried accepting the "Invite link" from the postman to join the team, but it did not allow you to log in hence you tried clicking on "Trouble signing in" but that did not send you the reset email?

Probably it is because you do not have a Postman account. Please click on "Create account", provide the email id, [unique username](https://support.getpostman.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019302273-Username-already-exists), and password and once the account is created you can click on the "Invite link" which should help you join the team.

If you still have issues logging in or joining the team, please reach out to us at [help@postman.com](help@postman.com).

### My credit card was declined - what do I do?

Unfortunately, we have little visibility over the reason for payments being declined. You can try using the same card after a little while, or try another card. You can also contact your credit card provider for more information.

If you are purchasing the Enterprise plan, you can pay via ACH, Wire Transfer or Check.

Contact us at sales@postman.com for more information.

### My Google account has two-factor authentication enabled, and I'm not able to 'Signin with Google' from the Postman app

At this point, Postman offers limited support for 2FA on Google accounts. If you're unable to complete the 2FA login process in the Postman app, your best bet would be to head to the link [Trouble signing in](https://identity.getpostman.com/trouble-signing-in) and request a new password. If you don't see any password reset emails from us even in Spam/ Junk folders, whitelist noreply@notifications.getpostman.com in your email client, or domain policy if necessary.

Once your password is reset, you can use your email + password combination to login through the app.
