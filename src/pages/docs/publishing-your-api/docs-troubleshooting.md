### I'm not able to access documentation via my configured custom domain

Postman Public Documentation published on a custom domain may not work due to the following reasons:

1. Domain verification not done.
2. Certificates from [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) not generated on your domain.

**1. Domain Verification** - Once a custom domain is added on your Postman account, it is important to complete the domain verification by creating the following DNS records:
**TXT record** - You need to configure on the root domain (eg: example.com)

**CNAME record** - need to be configured on the subdomain (eg: api.example.com or docs.example.com)

Please refer to the following [article](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/api_documentation/adding_and_verifying_custom_domains) for more information.

**2. Certificates from [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) not generated on your domain:**

Postman should have the authority to serve traffic on your domain. [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) lets us serve traffic by issuing us a certificate on your domain.

If your domain has CAA records set, you must explicitly allow LetsEncrypt to set certificates for your domain. Without this, certificates generated by LetsEncrypt won't be respected by browsers. To tackle this, follow this guide - [https://letsencrypt.org/docs/caa/](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/caa/) to add Letsencrypt to your CAA records.

### Why my published collection returns an error 403?

Your documentation may result in the below error 403 if the environment associated with the collection was created by a user who left the team.

![64537839-dd300400-d31b-11e9-8f4e-45a5156ba8cd.png](https://support.getpostman.com/hc/article_attachments/360049806254/64537839-dd300400-d31b-11e9-8f4e-45a5156ba8cd.png)

A quick way to verify that the error is caused by the unresolved environment is to **republish the collection without selecting any environment**.

To do so, head to your [Postman dashboard](http://app.getpostman.com/), select your collection and click on it. Then, click on ![Screen_Shot_2019-11-05_at_19.04.24.png](https://support.getpostman.com/hc/article_attachments/360050692893/Screen_Shot_2019-11-05_at_19.04.24.png)and select  _No Environment_

If your documentation is rendering fine without the Environment variable, let's go ahead and restore the environment. All you need to do is to **duplicate the environment**.

1\. Go to the Postman app and go to **Manage Environments**

2\. In the **Manage Environments** window, hit ![Screen_Shot_2019-11-05_at_19.12.27.png](https://support.getpostman.com/hc/article_attachments/360050694313/Screen_Shot_2019-11-05_at_19.12.27.png) next to the environment you want to restore.  
3\. Edit the Published documentation.  
4\. Select the new, duplicated environment.  
5\. Republish the collection
